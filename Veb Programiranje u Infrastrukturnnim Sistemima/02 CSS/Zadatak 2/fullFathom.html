            Full Fathom Five is one of the earliest masterpieces of Pollock's drip technique. The actual origins and
            initial development of this technique have never
            been fully explained, except by reading back from fuller photographic evidence produced about 1950, two or
            three years after this work was painted.
            Like other practical breakthroughs in twentieth-century painting, 'creative accident' seems likely to have
            played an important part, as Pollock probed
            and tested methods of paint application which promote the continuousness of line rather than the broken
            lines inevitable in the constant reloadings and
            readjustments of conventional brushwork.

            <i>His solution</i> was to pour from a can of domestic paint along a stick
            resting inside the container, so that a constant
            'beam' of pigment came into contact with the canvas (which he left unstretched on the studio floor). The
            character of the line was determined by certain physical
            and material variables that could be combined in almost infinite permutations: the viscosity of the paint
            (controlled by thinning and dilution); the angle and
            hence speed of the pouring; and the dynamics of Pollock's bodily gestures,
            his sweep and rhythm, especially in the wrist, arm and shoulder. 'Like a seismograph', noted writer Wemer
            Haftmann
            'the painting recorded the energies and states of the man who drew it.' In addition Pollock would flick,
            splatter and dab subsidiary colors on to the dominant
            linear configuration.
