            Pollock was the first ``all-over'' painter, pouring paint rather than using brushes and a palette, and
            abandoning all conventions of a central motif.
            He danced in semi-ecstasy over canvases spread across the floor, lost in his patternings, dripping and
            dribbling with total control. He said: ``The painting has a
            life of its own. I try to let it come through.'' He painted no image, just ``action'', though ``action
            painting'' seems an inadequate term for the finished result
            of his creative process.

            <i>Lavender Mist</i> is 3 m long (nearly 10 ft), a vast expanse on a heroic scale. It is
            alive with colored scribble, spattered lines moving this
            way and that, now thickening, now trailing off to a slender skein. The eye is kept continually eager, not
            allowed to rest on any particular area. Pollock has put
            his hands into paint and placed them at the top right-- an instinctive gesture eerily reminiscent of cave
            painters who did the same. The overall tone is a pale lavender,
            maide airy and active. At the time Pollock was heiled as the greatest American painter, but there are
            already those who feel his work is not holding up in every respect.
